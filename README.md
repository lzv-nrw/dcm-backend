# Digital Curation Manager - Backend

The 'DCM Backend'-API provides functionality to
* trigger an ingest in the archive-system,
* collect the current ingest-status,
* manage job/user/workspace/template configurations,
* control job execution, and
* authenticate local users.

This repository contains the corresponding Flask app definition.
For the associated OpenAPI-document, please refer to the sibling package [`dcm-backend-api`](https://github.com/lzv-nrw/dcm-backend-api).

The contents of this repository are part of the [`Digital Curation Manager`](https://github.com/lzv-nrw/digital-curation-manager).

## Ex Libris Rosetta authorization HTTP header

Using the Rosetta REST-API requires authentication via the `Basic` HTTP authentication scheme (see [docs](https://developers.exlibrisgroup.com/rosetta/apis/rest-apis/)).
The file `convert_credentials.sh` contains a helper script to generate that headers contents.
An output destination can optionally be given as first argument (with default being `~/.rosetta/rosetta_auth`).
The user is then prompted to provide the institution code, the username, and the password for the specific Rosetta instance.

In order to test the generated header, use, for example, the following curl-command:
```
curl -X GET "<API-base-url>/rest/v0/deposits" -H @<path-to-header-file> -H 'accept: application/json'
```

## Local install
Make sure to include the extra-index-url `https://zivgitlab.uni-muenster.de/api/v4/projects/9020/packages/pypi/simple` in your [pip-configuration](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#finding-packages) to enable an automated install of all dependencies.
Using a virtual environment is recommended.

1. Install with
   ```
   pip install .
   ```
1. Configure service environment to fit your needs ([see here](#environmentconfiguration)).
1. Run app as
   ```
   flask run --port=8080
   ```
1. To manually use the API, either run command line tools like `curl` as, e.g.,
   ```
   curl -X 'POST' \
     'http://localhost:8080/ingest' \
     -H 'accept: application/json' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{
     "ingest": {
       "archiveId": "40be1c3a-2a6a-4656-9996-078fc9364ac4",
       "target": {
         "subdirectory": "2468edf8-6706-4ff0-bd03-04512d082c28"
       }
     }
   }'
   ```
   or run a gui-application, like Swagger UI, based on the OpenAPI-document provided in the sibling package [`dcm-backend-api`](https://github.com/lzv-nrw/dcm-backend-api).

## Docker
Build an image using, for example,
```
docker build -t dcm/backend:dev .
```
Then run with
```
docker run --rm --name=backend -v ~/.rosetta/rosetta_auth:/home/dcm/.rosetta/rosetta_auth -p 8080:80 dcm/backend:dev
```
and test by making a GET-http://localhost:8080/identify request.

For additional information, refer to the documentation [here](https://github.com/lzv-nrw/digital-curation-manager).

## Tests
Install additional dev-dependencies with
```
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
```
Run unit-tests with
```
pytest -v -s
```

## Environment/Configuration
Service-specific environment variables are

### Database
* `DB_LOAD_SCHEMA` [DEFAULT 0]: whether the database should be initialized with the database schema
* `DB_GENERATE_DEMO` [DEFAULT 0]: whether database-tables and related configuration should be filled with demo-data at startup (also includes `DB_GENERATE_DEMO_USERS`)
* `DB_GENERATE_DEMO_USERS` [DEFAULT 0]: whether demo users are created at startup

  Three regular users are created. User 'einstein' with password 'relativity', user 'curie' with password 'radioactivity',
  and user 'feynman' with password 'superfluidity'.
  Furthermore, an administrator called 'admin' is created, the corresponding password is printed to stdout on app-startup (see also `DB_DEMO_ADMIN_PW`).
* `DB_DEMO_ADMIN_PW` [DEFAULT null] if set, the generated administrator-account gets assigned this password instead of a random one
* `DB_STRICT_SCHEMA_VERSION` [DEFAULT 0] whether to enforce matching database schema version with respect to currently installed `dcm-database`

### Users
* `REQUIRE_USER_ACTIVATION` [DEFAULT 1]: whether new users are required to set password before login

### Templates
* `HOTFOLDER_SRC` [DEFAULT '[]']: array of hotfolders as JSON or path to a (UTF-8 encoded) JSON-file; every entry of that array needs to have the following signature
  ```json
  {
    "id": "<unique id>",
    "mount": "<mount path of the hotfolder>",
    "name": "<display name of hotfolder>",
    "description": "<(optional) description for hotfolder>"
  }
  ```

  Note that the `"id"` is passed on to the [Import Module](https://github.com/lzv-nrw/dcm-import-module) during execution of a job with hotfolder-import.
  Hence, the Import Module requires a matching definition of hotfolders.

### Scheduling
* `SCHEDULING_CONTROLS_API` [DEFAULT 0] whether the scheduling-api is available
* `SCHEDULING_AT_STARTUP` [DEFAULT 1] whether job scheduling-loop is active at startup
* `SCHEDULING_TIMEZONE` [DEFAULT null] timezone used during scheduling; if null, uses the system default (use python3's `import zoneinfo; zoneinfo.available_timezones()` to view all available options)

### Job Execution (Job Controller)
* `JOB_PROCESSOR_TIMEOUT` [DEFAULT 30] service timeout duration in seconds
* `JOB_PROCESSOR_HOST` [DEFAULT http://localhost:8087] Job Processor host address
* `JOB_PROCESSOR_POLL_INTERVAL` [DEFAULT 1.0] Job Processor polling interval

### Ingest (Archive Controller)
* `ROSETTA_AUTH_FILE` [DEFAULT "~/.rosetta/rosetta_auth"]: path to file with the Authorization HTTP header for all requests
* `ROSETTA_MATERIAL_FLOW`: ID of the Material Flow used for deposit activities
* `ROSETTA_PRODUCER`: Producer ID of deposit activities
* `ARCHIVE_API_BASE_URL` [DEFAULT "https://lzv-test.hbz-nrw.de"]: url to the archive instance
* `ARCHIVE_API_PROXY` [DEFAULT null]: JSON object containing a mapping of protocol name and corresponding proxy-address

Additionally this service provides environment options for
* `BaseConfig`,
* `OrchestratedAppConfig`, and
* `DBConfig`

as listed [here](https://github.com/lzv-nrw/dcm-common#app-configuration).
